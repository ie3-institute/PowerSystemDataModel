# Documentation of the PowerSystemDataModel

Welcome to the documentation of the PowerSystemDataModel.
It provides an extensive data model capable of modelling energy systems with high granularity e.g. for bottom-up simulations.
Additionally, useful functions to process, augment and furnish model i/o information is provided.
Effective handling of geographic information related to power grids is also possible.
