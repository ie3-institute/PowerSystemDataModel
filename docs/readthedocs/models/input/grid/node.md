# Node

Representation of an electrical node, with no further distinction into bus bar, auxiliary node or others.

## Caveats

System participants, that need to have geographical locations, inherit the position from the node.
If the overall location does not play a big role, you are able to use the default location with
{code}`NodeInput#DEFAULT_GEO_POSITION` being located on TU Dortmund university's campus ([See on OpenStreetMaps](https://www.openstreetmap.org/search?query=51.4843281%2C%207.4116482#map=15/51.4843/7.4117)).
