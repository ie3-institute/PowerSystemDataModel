/**
 * Source that provides the capability to build thermal {@link
 * edu.ie3.datamodel.models.input.AssetInput} entities from .csv files
 *
 * <p>This source is <b>not buffered</b> which means each call on a getter method always tries to
 * read all data is necessary to return the requested objects in a hierarchical cascading way.
 *
 * <p>If performance is an issue, it is recommended to read the data cascading starting with reading
 * nodes and then using the getters with arguments to avoid reading the same data multiple times.
 *
 * <p>The resulting sets are always unique on object <b>and</b> UUID base (with distinct UUIDs).
